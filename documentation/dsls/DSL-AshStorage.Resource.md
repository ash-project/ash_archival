### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Docs |
|------|------|---------|------|
| [`attribute`](#storage-attribute){: #storage-attribute } | `atom` | `:stored_at` | The attribute in which to store the storage flag (the current datetime). |
| [`attribute_type`](#storage-attribute_type){: #storage-attribute_type } | `atom` | `:utc_datetime_usec` | The attribute type. |
| [`base_filter?`](#storage-base_filter?){: #storage-base_filter? } | `atom` | `false` | Whether or not a base filter exists that applies the `is_nil(stored_at)` rule. |
| [`exclude_read_actions`](#storage-exclude_read_actions){: #storage-exclude_read_actions } | `atom \| list(atom)` | `[]` | A read action or actions that should show stored items. They will not get the automatic `is_nil(stored_at)` filter. |
| [`exclude_upsert_actions`](#storage-exclude_upsert_actions){: #storage-exclude_upsert_actions } | `atom \| list(atom)` | `[]` | This option is deprecated as it no longer has any effect. Upserts are handled according to the upsert identity. See the upserts guide for more. |
| [`exclude_destroy_actions`](#storage-exclude_destroy_actions){: #storage-exclude_destroy_actions } | `atom \| list(atom)` | `[]` | A destroy action or actions that should *not* store, but instead be left alone. This allows for having a destroy *or* store pattern. |
| [`storage_related`](#storage-storage_related){: #storage-storage_related } | `list(atom)` | `[]` | A list of relationships that should have all related items stored when this is stored. Notifications are not sent for this operation. |
| [`storage_related_arguments`](#storage-storage_related_arguments){: #storage-storage_related_arguments } | `(any, any -> any) \| module` |  | A function to allow passing along some of the arguments to related resources when storing them. |
