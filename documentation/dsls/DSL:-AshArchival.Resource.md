### Options

| Name | Type | Default | Docs |
|------|------|---------|------|
| [`attribute`](#archive-attribute){: #archive-attribute } | `atom` | `:archived_at` | The attribute in which to store the archival flag (the current datetime). |
| [`exclude_read_actions`](#archive-exclude_read_actions){: #archive-exclude_read_actions } | `atom \| list(atom)` | `[]` | A read action or actions that should show archived items. They will not get the automatic `is_nil(archived_at)` filter. |
| [`exclude_destroy_actions`](#archive-exclude_destroy_actions){: #archive-exclude_destroy_actions } | `atom \| list(atom)` | `[]` | A destroy action or actions that should *not* archive, but instead be left alone. This allows for having a destroy *or* archive pattern. |
| [`archive_related`](#archive-archive_related){: #archive-archive_related } | `list(atom)` | `[]` | A list of relationships that should have all related items archived when this is archived. Notifications are not sent for this operation. |
